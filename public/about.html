<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello Guys,
  I am Rohan Dutta.I am from one of the most famous historical place in India and that place is Bihar.
  Currently i am pursuing my bachelor's in Technology in Electonics And Communication field from Siliguri 
  Institute of Technology which is located in Siliguri.</p>
  <p>
  The reason to select this field of electronics for my bachelor's degree is that many of my experienced
  elders told me about of the future of this electronics industry in our country and these talks with my
  elders makes me really fascinated about this precious Electonics industry and also whwn i joined
  the college for my bachelor's under this specific branch or field,i realised that my elders
  were absolutelu true about all this.So ya I am enjoying this very much.

<p>Currently i am working on Web Development skills because it is very much required in the market
  for now.So yes i will be mastering this much required skill in just few months.
